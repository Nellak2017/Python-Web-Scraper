# Python-Web-Scraper
A custom built Web Scraper I am using to gather data for statistical analysis of average typing speeds.

## Overview

This project is being used for my introduction to Statistics class at UCO. In this project, I will gather a random sample of typing speeds from Keyhero.com.
Once sampled, I will estimate the average typing speed of the population with a 99% confidence interval with +- 2 words per minute uncertainty.
